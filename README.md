spanning-tree
=============

Second Data Structures Project - Uses Kruskal's Algorithm to create a spanning tree.


The actual 'data structures' part was pretty straightforward. Matching the professor's anal
specifications was hell.

input file format:

number_of_cities
number_of_roads
start_city end_city weight   (start_city and end_city are numbers)
etc.

ex:

5
1
1 2 4
